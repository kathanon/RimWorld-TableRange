# RimWorld-TableRange
When placing or selecting a table, shows roughly from how far pawns will travel to use it (for ingestible items with default search range).

Also adds the ability to change that range, both globally and for specific tables.

When looking for a place to eat, pawns do not look for a table, they look for a free chair next to a table. This means that the range shown is approximate - it depends on where there are free chairs.
